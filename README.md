# VIEW/MATERIALIZED VIEW in RethinkDB

This is just a train of thoughts about how to reproduce the functionality of a SQL VIEW/MATERIALIZED VIEW in rethinkDB.


## Setup

You need **the following software**:
- RethinkDB (download it from http://rethinkdb.com). Install and start it (command is global, but remember to use a test data directory, something like `rethinkdb -d /data/rethinkdb_data/`). You can then connect to the web console at `http://localhost:8080/#`. You can query the db from the _Data Explorer_ tab.
- Node.js, and the rethinkdb package (install via npm) to run `test.js` (the example)

The **data model** is:
- One db `test1` with one table `sales`.
  You can add elements in it in the form:
```json
    {
        "desc" : "fourth sale in october",
        "date" : ISODate("2014-10-14T23:00:00.000Z")
    }
```
  by running
```javascript
	// execute only once
	r.dbCreate("test1")
	r.db("test1").tableCreate("sales")
	
	// execute many times to populate the table with entries with different dates
	r.db('test1').table("sales").insert({desc: "second sales in november", date: r.time(2014, 11, 6, '+08:00')})
```

## Presentation
The **"presentation"** (such a pretentious word) goes like that:

1. You can easily create the aggregation by querying in ReQL: `r.db('test1').table("sales").group([r.row("date").year(), r.row("date").month()]).count()`

2. However, there is no equivalent to the mongo `$out`, so your only option is query via a client and then re-insert the data in a new table

3. The option of monitoring for changes on a table is available also in rethinkDB. It is kind of more "official" than the mongoDB equivalent "hack" of tailing the oplog. It is called [change feeds](http://rethinkdb.com/docs/changefeeds/javascript)

4. You can create a cursor that is returning an object every time a specific table is updated. In the example below (also in `test.js`, I create a changefeed on the `sales` table:

	```javascript
	connect().then(function(conn){
		r.table('sales').changes().run(conn)
		.then(function(cursor){
			// do something with the cursor
		});
	});
	```

5. What you can do with the cursor is iterate on it using `forEach`.
	```javascript
	cursor.each(function(err, item){

	```
	the `item` object is as follows:
	```json
	{
		old_val: {...},
		new_val: {...}	
	}

	```

6. Outside of the db also here, like in mongoDB. However, a BIG BIG plus is that each change "notification" have access to the _old_ value of each object in addition to the _new_ one (in mongodb, there was no way to retrieve the old value of the row from the oplog, as it contains only the changes to apply).
